\section{Personal Statement}

\begin{statement}

As a biostatistician, I have specialized myself in the areas of machine learning and its application to large environmental and clinical datasets.  Recent democratization of “big spatial data” and advances in geoinformatics have allowed unprecedented access to environmental characteristics that can be used to estimate exposures to pollutants that vary highly with respect to both time and space. More precise environmental features require more complex models and I have dedicated my early career to furthering exposure science methodology in order to bring more precise exposure assessments to environmental health studies. I have created different spatiotemporal land use models based on the machine learning technique called random forest. Development of the land use random forest (LURF) model has also lead to methodological contributions to the random forest model itself.

The proposed work to examine the relation between early life ambient air pollution exposure and cardiometabolic outcomes later in life will benefit from my recently developed spatiotemporal PM$_{2.5}$ exposure assessment model.  My expertise will be useful in both extending the current model to a higher spatiotemporal resolution and in estimating early life exposure to children in the cohorts.\\

\section{Contribution to Science}

\begin{enumerate}


\item The main aim of my early career work has been to develop exposure assessment models for airborne pollutants based on machine learning techniques.  Specifically, applying random forest to land use models results in higher accuracy and precision of air pollution exposure assessment by elucidating complex interactions and nonlinear relationships between land use predictors and pollutant concentrations. This work includes the first machine learning or ensemble model used to assess exposure to elemental components of particulate matter. Recent introduction of remote sensing satellite data has allowed for extension of the land use random forest model to produce daily estimates of air pollution from 2000 - 2015 at a resolution of 1 x 1 km across the Greater Cincinnati area.

\end{enumerate}

\item The work in developing LURF methods has helped me gain expertise in geospatial computing.  Along with other collaborators, I have applied these geospatial techniques to analyze the effect on health of other environmental exposures such as combined sewer overflows, elemental components of particulate matter, greenspace, and ozone.

\end{enumerate}

\item Collaborating with other researchers wishing to use geospatial characteristics of research participants within existing cohorts and multisite studies has highlighted the significant need for a reproducible and distributed method for extracting place-based information from a residential address while maintaining the privacy of protected health information. I recently developed a novel approach and accompanying software package called DeGAUSS which overcomes the multiple challenges in the use of address data in multi-site studies and also serves as a more general reproducible research tool for geocoding and geomarker assessment. This approach is currently being implemented in a wide variety of national environmental health studies.

\textbf{Internal Processes and Methods Award - Center for Clinical \&
	Translational Science \& Training}\\
\emph{Using Machine Learning to Supplement Electronic Health Record
	databases with Individual Socioeconomic Status}\\
Brokamp, PI (9/1/17 - 12/31/17)\\
Retrospective epidemiological studies are often created using electronic
health record databases. Although these records are ``wide'', they are
not ``deep'' with respect to individual level demographic data. We
propose a novel machine learning based approach that uses open city and
auditor databases to predict individual level income and family
socioeconomic status. This will solve the urgent problem of
unconfounding for individual SES in the execution of EHR based
research.\\
Role: PI

\textbf{NIH/NIEHS 1R01ES019890-01}\\
\emph{Neurobehavioral and Neuroimaging Effects of Traffic Exposure in
	Children}\\
Ryan, PI (7/1/12 - 3/31/18)\\
The association between exposure to traffic-related air pollutants
(TRAP) during early childhood and neurobehavioral and neuroimaging
outcomes has not been thoroughly examined. The objective of the proposed
study is to determine if children exposed to increased levels of TRAP
during critical time periods of brain development have altered
neurobehavior in childhood as measured by a battery of valid and
reliable tests and to assess the physiologic impact of TRAP exposure on
brain structure, organization, and function using quantitative magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI). These results will fill important gaps in
current scientific knowledge related to the relationship between TRAP
exposure and neurobehavior and central nervous system effects.\\

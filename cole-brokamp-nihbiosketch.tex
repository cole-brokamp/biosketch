\section{Personal Statement}

\begin{statement}

I am an environmental and population health scientist trained at the
intersection of biostatistics, epidemiology, and geoinformatics in order to
advance precision public health. My work has focused on using
GIS, machine learning, and causal inference methods with ``big spatial data'' to
estimate the effect of spatiotemporal environmental exposures on neurobehavioral and
psychiatric pediatric health outcomes. Specifically, my interest lies in the
interaction of these urban exposures with individual- and community-level
socioeconomic characteristics in order to to identify subpopulations of children
who are more susceptible to environmental health problems and inform targeted
interventions. I am also the founding director of the Geospatial Research Accelerator for Precision Population Health (GRAPPH) at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, a shared facility that works to develop and democratize geospatial data and methodologies across the institution.

I look forward to contributing to Dr. Marusak's innovative and timely proposed R21 award that will be
the first to test whether ambient air pollution increases risk of anxiety via impaired development of fear extinction neural circuitry during adolescence.
 My expertise and experience in developing spatiotemporal PM$_{2.5}$ exposure assessment models will help me
contribute to accomplishing both specific aims.  Specifically, I will advise
and assist in estimation of PM$_{2.5}$ levels, both cumulative lifetime
exposures and more recent exposures based on participants' residential
addresses. Additionally, I will leverage my expertise in environmental
epidemiology and biostatistical methods, specifically for longitudinal
PM$_{2.5}$ and psychiatric health outcomes to assist with the selection of appropriate statistical tests, covariates, and analyses.

\section{Contribution to Science}

\begin{enumerate}

\item My early career has been spent developing spatiotemporal exposure assessment models for
  enivronmental pollutants and community characteristics based on machine learning
  techniques.  This work includes the first machine
  learning or ensemble model used to assess exposure to elemental components of
  particulate matter. Recent introduction of remote sensing satellite data has
  allowed for extension of the land use random forest model to produce daily
  estimates of air pollution back to 2000 at a resolution of 1 x 1 km.

\end{enumerate}

\item Building on advanced exposure assessment models has allowed me to lead epidemiological studies on the impacts of the built environment (e.g., fine particulate matter, greenspace, combined sewer overflows, community deprivation) on several different pediatric health outcomes (e.g., psychiatric, neurobehavioral, gastrointestinal, and all-cause hospital utilization).

  \end{enumerate}

\item I have developed a novel approach and accompanying software package called DeGAUSS
  which overcomes multiple privacy-related challenges in the use of address data in
  multi-site studies and also serves as a more general reproducible and scalable
  research tool for geocoding and geomarker assessment. This approach is currently being
  implemented in a wide variety of national environmental health studies. Extending this
  approach into a scalable and sustainable framework for automated integration of
  disparate and heterogeneous geomarkers via spatiotemporal location has reduced
  the need for manual data curation and specialized expertise required
  to utilize them within biomedical research studies.

\end{enumerate}

\item Lastly, I have contributed to a research team that has recently used
  functional data analysis combined with joint modeling (FD-JM) to identify and
  predict rapid decline in lung function among patients with cystic fibrosis
  (CF) lung disease. My work in translating this predictive model into an interactive application has allowed for patients and clinicians to take advantage of it at the bedside.  Focus groups and partnerships with clinicians have allowed us to iteratively develop the application based on end-user feedback. Work with the CF Foundation Patient Registry (CFFPR) to implement these models and visualizations into clinical settings has improved prognostic care.

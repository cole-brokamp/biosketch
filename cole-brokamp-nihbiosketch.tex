\section{Personal Statement}

\begin{statement}
As a biostatistician, I have specialized myself in the areas of machine learning and its application to large environmental and clinical datasets.  Recent democratization of “big spatial data” and advances in geoinformatics have allowed for linkage of geographic and demographic data to electronic health records and research cohorts. My expertise in open source spatial data tools like GDAL, GEOS, and PROJ.4 will allow for efficient and transparent assembly of the proposed dataset.  Futhermore, my experience with machine learning, including theoretical contributions to random forest methodology will allow me to lead a team to develop the optimal predictive algorithm for personal socioeconomic status.  Recent experience with geocoding hospital-wide EHR data will provide me with expertise needed to clean, manage, and apply the training data. \\

\section{Contribution to Science}

I recently applied machine learning methods to estimate the exposure of children to different types of air pollution and quantified its effects on their respiratory and mental health. Specifically, I created a novel land use random forest model (LURF) and showed that it was more accurate and precise than traditional land use regression models. This work has been implemented into an R package that helps researchers to extract statistical inferences from random forests, as well as to aid users in the application and visualization of big spatial data.\\

\textbf{NIH/NIEHS 1R01ES019890-01}\\
\emph{Neurobehavioral and Neuroimaging Effects of Traffic Exposure in
	Children}\\
Ryan, PI (7/1/12 - 3/31/18)\\
The association between exposure to traffic-related air pollutants
(TRAP) during early childhood and neurobehavioral and neuroimaging
outcomes has not been thoroughly examined. The objective of the proposed
study is to determine if children exposed to increased levels of TRAP
during critical time periods of brain development have altered
neurobehavior in childhood as measured by a battery of valid and
reliable tests and to assess the physiologic impact of TRAP exposure on
brain structure, organization, and function using quantitative magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI). These results will fill important gaps in
current scientific knowledge related to the relationship between TRAP
exposure and neurobehavior and central nervous system effects.\\

\textbf{NIH 5K23AI121325}\\
\emph{Biomarkers and Risk Stratification in Pediatric Community}\\
Florin, PI (01/01/16 - 12/31/19)\\
The extensive variation in care, in addition to the lack of
evidence-based decision aids, highlights the critical need for an
improved understanding of disease severity and tools to guide management
for pediatric CAP. The proposed research will address this important
knowledge and practice gap.\\

\section{Personal Statement}

\begin{statement}

I am an environmental and population health scientist trained at the
intersection of biostatistics, epidemiology, and geoinformatics in order to
advance precision public health. My work has focused on using
GIS, machine learning, and causal inference methods with ``big spatial data'' to
estimate the effect of spatiotemporal environmental exposures on neurobehavioral and
psychiatric pediatric health
outcomes. Specifically, my interest lies in the
interaction of these urban exposures with individual- and community-level
socioeconomic characteristics in order to to identify subpopulations of children
who are more susceptible to environmental health problems and inform targeted
interventions.

In this project, I will serve as a co-Investigator and will utilize my
expertise and experience in clincial machine learning prediction models to
develop and implement an early warning system for units at
CCHMC. Working with the other investigators, I will contribute to Aim 2 by
developing time-series and machine learning models to identify possible
interventions to reduce injury rates and also to predict injury rates specific
to each unit and to the hospital overall.  I will also work to integrate these
models into an interactive heatmap dashboard and early notifications that will
comprise the early-warning system developed in Aim 3. My experience in
developing temporal and spatiotemporal machine learning prediction models will
allow me to successfully collaborate as a part of this team and contribute to
successful completion of the study aims.\\

\section{Contribution to Science}

\begin{enumerate}

\item My early career has been spent developing exposure assessment models for
  spatialtemporal pollutants and community characteristics based on machine learning
  techniques.  This work includes the first machine
  learning or ensemble model used to assess exposure to elemental components of
  particulate matter. Recent introduction of remote sensing satellite data has
  allowed for extension of the land use random forest model to produce daily
  estimates of air pollution back to 2000 at a resolution of 1 x 1 km.

\end{enumerate}

\item Building on advanced exposure assessment models has allowed me to lead epidemiological studies on the impacts of the built environment (e.g., fine particulate matter, greenspace, combined sewer overflows, community deprivation) on several different pediatric health outcomes (e.g., psychiatric, neurobehavioral, gastrointestinal, and all-cause hospital utilization).

  \end{enumerate}

\item I have developed a novel approach and accompanying software package called DeGAUSS
  which overcomes the multiple privacy-related challenges in the use of address data in
  multi-site studies and also serves as a more general reproducible research
  tool for geocoding and geomarker assessment. This approach is currently being
  implemented in a wide variety of national environmental health studies. Extending this
  approach into a scalable and sustainable framework for automated integration of
  disparate and heterogeneous geomarkers via spatiotemporal location has reduced
  the need for manual data curation and specialized expertise required
  to utilize them within biomedical research studies.

\end{enumerate}

\item I have also contributed to several studies on the disparities of health outcomes within children and the contribution of the place-based and social determinants of health to these disparities in order to identify root causes and meaningful solutions.

\end{enumerate}

\item Lastly, I have contributed to a research team that has recently used
  functional data analysis combined with joint modeling (FD-JM) to identify and
  predict rapid decline in lung function among patients with cystic fibrosis
  (CF) lung disease. My work in translating this predictive model into an interactive application has allowed for patients and clinicians to take advantage of it at the bedside.  Focus groups and partnerships with clinicians have allowed us to iteratively develop the application based on end-user feedback. Work with the CF Foundation Patient Registry (CFFPR) to implement these models and visualizations into clinical settings has improved prognostic care.

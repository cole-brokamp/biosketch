\section{Personal Statement}

\begin{statement}

  As a biostatistician and geoinformatician, I have specialized myself in the areas of machine learning and its application to large environmental and clinical datasets. Recent democratization of “big spatial data” and advances in geoinformatics have allowed unprecedented access to environmental and socioeconomic characteristics that vary highly with respect to both time and space. More precise environmental features require more complex modeling and I have dedicated my early career to furthering exposure science methodology in order to bring more precise exposure assessment tools to environmental and population health studies. Furthermore, I have developed a novel approach and accompanying software package called DeGAUSS which allows for user-friendly attachment of geospatial variables to existing research cohorts while mitigating key privacy challenges. I am the founding director of the Geospatial Research Accelerator for Precision Population Health (GRAPPH), which is a shared facility at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center that works to develop and democratize geospatial data and methodologies across the institution. 

  For this proposed work, I will work to conduct geomarker assessment among AYA pediatric cancer survivors living in the state of Oklahoma.  I will use my experience and expertise in supplementing cohort data with measures of material community deprivation, greenness, and other measures of access to care.

\section{Contributions to Science}

\begin{enumerate}

\item My early career has been spent developing spatiotemporal exposure assessment models for
  enivronmental pollutants and community characteristics based on machine learning
  techniques.  This work includes the first machine
  learning or ensemble model used to assess exposure to elemental components of
  particulate matter. Recent introduction of remote sensing satellite data has
  allowed for extension of the land use random forest model to produce daily
  estimates of air pollution back to 2000 at a resolution of 1 x 1 km.

\end{enumerate}

\item Building on advanced exposure assessment models has allowed me to lead epidemiological studies on the impacts of the built environment (e.g., fine particulate matter, greenspace, combined sewer overflows, community deprivation) on several different pediatric health outcomes (e.g., psychiatric, neurobehavioral, and all-cause hospital utilization).

  \end{enumerate}

\item I have developed a novel approach and accompanying software package called DeGAUSS
  which overcomes multiple privacy-related challenges in the use of address data in
  multi-site studies and also serves as a more general reproducible and scalable
  research tool for geocoding and geomarker assessment. This approach is currently being
  implemented in a wide variety of national environmental health studies. Extending this
  approach into a scalable and sustainable framework for automated integration of
  disparate and heterogeneous geomarkers via spatiotemporal location has reduced
  the need for manual data curation and specialized expertise required
  to utilize them within biomedical research studies.

\end{enumerate}

\item Lastly, I have contributed to a research team that has recently used
  functional data analysis combined with joint modeling (FD-JM) to identify and
  predict rapid decline in lung function among patients with cystic fibrosis
  (CF) lung disease. My work in translating this predictive model into an interactive application has allowed for patients and clinicians to take advantage of it at the bedside.  Focus groups and partnerships with clinicians have allowed us to iteratively develop the application based on end-user feedback. Work with the CF Foundation Patient Registry (CFFPR) to implement these models and visualizations into clinical settings has improved prognostic care.

\section{Contribution to Science}

\begin{enumerate}


\item The main aim of my early career work has been to develop exposure assessment models for airborne pollutants based on machine learning techniques.  Specifically, applying random forest to land use models results in higher accuracy and precision of air pollution exposure assessment by elucidating complex interactions and nonlinear relationships between land use predictors and pollutant concentrations. This work includes the first machine learning or ensemble model used to assess exposure to elemental components of particulate matter. Recent introduction of remote sensing satellite data has allowed for extension of the land use random forest model to produce daily estimates of air pollution from 2000 - 2015 at a resolution of 1 x 1 km across the Greater Cincinnati area.

\end{enumerate}

\item Collaborating with other researchers wishing to use geospatial characteristics of research participants within existing cohorts and multi-site studies has highlighted the significant need for a reproducible and distributed method for extracting place-based information from a residential address while maintaining the privacy of protected health information. I recently developed a novel approach and accompanying software package called DeGAUSS which overcomes the multiple challenges in the use of address data in multi-site studies and also serves as a more general reproducible research tool for geocoding and geomarker assessment. This approach is currently being implemented in a wide variety of national environmental health studies.

\end{enumerate}

\item The work in developing land use random forest methods has helped me gain expertise in geospatial computing.  Along with other collaborators, I have applied my geospatial computing and geoinformatics expertise to analyze the effect on health of environmental exposures such as combined sewer overflows, elemental components of particulate matter, community deprivation, greenspace, and ozone.

\item We have recently used functional data analysis combined with joint modeling (FD-JM) to identify and predict rapid decline in lung function among patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease. Translating this predictive model into an interactive application has allowed for patients and clinicians to take advantage of it at the bedside.  Focus groups and partnerships with clinicians have allowed us to iteratively develop the application based on end-user feedback. Work with the CF Foundation Patient Registry (CFFPR) to implement these models and visualizations into clinical settings has improved prognostic care.

\emph{Using Machine Learning to Supplement Electronic Health Record
	databases with Individual Socioeconomic Status}\\
Brokamp, PI (9/1/17 - 6/30/19)\\
Retrospective epidemiological studies are often created using electronic
health record databases. Although these records are ``wide'', they are
not ``deep'' with respect to individual level demographic data. We
propose a novel machine learning based approach that uses open city and
auditor databases to predict individual level income and family
socioeconomic status. This will solve the urgent problem of
unconfounding for individual SES in the execution of EHR based
research.\\

\emph{Neurobehavioral and Neuroimaging Effects of Traffic Exposure in
	Children}\\
Ryan, PI (7/1/12 - 3/31/18)\\
The association between exposure to traffic-related air pollutants
(TRAP) during early childhood and neurobehavioral and neuroimaging
outcomes has not been thoroughly examined. The objective of the proposed
study is to determine if children exposed to increased levels of TRAP
during critical time periods of brain development have altered
neurobehavior in childhood as measured by a battery of valid and
reliable tests and to assess the physiologic impact of TRAP exposure on
brain structure, organization, and function using quantitative magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI). These results will fill important gaps in
current scientific knowledge related to the relationship between TRAP
exposure and neurobehavior and central nervous system effects.\\

\section{Personal Statement}

\begin{statement}

  As a biostatistician, epidemiologist, and geospatial data scientist, I have specialized myself in the areas of informatics and machine learning with applications to large environmental and health outcome datasets. Recent democratization of “big spatial data” and advances in geoinformatics have allowed unprecedented access to environmental and socioeconomic characteristics that vary highly with respect to both time and space. More precise environmental features require more complex modeling and I have dedicated my career to furthering exposure science methodology in order to bring more precise exposure assessment tools to environmental and population health studies. This includes high resolution spatiotemporal exposure assessment models for fine particulate matter as well as a longitudinal measure of material community deprivation. Leveraging these models, I've also lead epidemiologic studies demonstrating the roles of air pollution, greenspace, and poverty on psychiatric and neurobehavioral child health outcomes. Furthermore, I have developed a novel approach and accompanying software package called DeGAUSS which allows for user-friendly attachment of geospatial variables to existing research cohorts while mitigating key privacy challenges. I am the founding director of the Geospatial Research Accelerator for Precision Population Health (GRAPPH), which is a shared facility at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center that works to develop and democratize geospatial data and methodologies across the institution. 

I look forward to contributing as the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center Site PI, and as the Lead for Residential History, Geocoding \& Environmental Data (Milestones 7, 8, and 9) for the NIH All of US Center for Linkage and Acquisition of Data (CLAD). My expertise and experience in (1) developing high resolution exposure assessment models, (2) creating exposure assessment pipelines for observational studies, and (3) leading environmental epidemiology studies will help me contriute to accomplishing the technical requirements and scientific goals.  Specifically, I recently implemented a geocoding and geomarker assessment pipeline for the NIH Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) Program that linked existing address data in a secure, decentralized manner to high resolution, daily exposure estimates for three major ambient air pollutants. This work resulted in lifetime daily measures of fine particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone for each study participant while mitigating key privacy challenges where exact addresses and dates could not be shared.

\section{Contributions to Science}

\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Spatiotemporal exposure assessment methods and machine learning models}

  My early career was spent developing spatiotemporal exposure assessment models for
  environmental pollutants and community characteristics based on machine learning
  techniques.  This work includes the first machine
  learning or ensemble model used to assess exposure to elemental components of
  particulate matter. Recent introduction of remote sensing satellite data has
  allowed for extension of the land use random forest model to produce daily
  estimates of air pollution back to 2000 at a resolution of 1 x 1 km. Additionally,
  I have built a validated community material deprivation index that has been used and cited
  by over 75 different published scientific studies.

    2019.

\end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Built Environment and Pediatric Psychiatric Disorders}

  Building on advanced exposure assessment has allowed me to lead epidemiological studies on the impacts of the built environment (e.g., fine particulate matter, greenspace, community deprivation) on psychiatric and neurobehavioral pediatric health outcomes. I lead the first study to associate fine particulate matter with psychiatric outcomes in children and adolescents, using both electronic health record studies, as well as smaller, longitudinal panel studies.

  \end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Privacy-based Methods and Software for Geocoding and Geomarker Assessment}

  I have developed a novel approach and accompanying software package called DeGAUSS
  which overcomes multiple privacy-related challenges in the use of address data in
  multi-site studies and also serves as a more general reproducible and scalable
  research tool for geocoding and geomarker assessment. This approach is currently being
  implemented in a wide variety of national environmental health studies. Extending this
  approach into a scalable and sustainable framework for automated integration of
  disparate and heterogeneous geomarkers via spatiotemporal location has reduced
  the need for manual data curation and specialized expertise required
  to utilize them within biomedical research studies.

\end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Pediatric Health Disparities}

  I have also contributed to several studies on the disparities of health outcomes within children and the contribution of the place-based and social determinants of health to these disparities in order to identify root causes and meaningful solutions.

\end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Clinical Forecasting in Cystic Fibrosis with Geomarkers}

  Lastly, I have contributed to a research team that has recently used
  functional data analysis combined with joint modeling (FD-JM) to identify and
  predict rapid decline in lung function among patients with cystic fibrosis
  (CF) lung disease. My work in translating this predictive model into an interactive application has allowed for patients and clinicians to take advantage of it at the bedside.  Focus groups and partnerships with clinicians have allowed us to iteratively develop the application based on end-user feedback. Work with the CF Foundation Patient Registry (CFFPR) to implement these models and visualizations into clinical settings has improved prognostic care.
